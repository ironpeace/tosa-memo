Today, I would like to introduce one of TED’s speech.
The title is “How I hacked online dating”.

~~~~

Do you know TED ?
TED is a global set of conferences under the slogan “ideas worth spreading”.
In this web sites, the speech of those conderences are uploaded.

~~~~

The speech which I choose is one of the most favorite speeche in last year.
Have you ever watched this movie?
As you can see in the title, this speech is about the story which Amy Webb found her husband in an online-dating.

~~~~

Her speech is not only very fun, 

~~~~

But also very interesting in terms of these points.
First is about her approaching method to the online-dating. She adopt a very unique method of data-science to get her ideal husband.
Second is her encouraging message. Her message is very encouraging for people who is in hardship or is tring hard challenge.

~~~~

In her story, there are some ups and downs.
This chart shows them.
So, I’ll show you her story along this chart.

~~~~

A few years ago, she was 30 years old, she didn’t have boy-friend who will be her husband.
And her very large family was already all married and well on their way to having lots and lots of children.
And she felt like she was under tremendous peer pressure.

~~~~

Her grandmother, who always had plenty of advice,  said, "Stop being so picky. You've got to date around.“
It means that let down your hurdle and let big your target.
And have lots of date with men.
And her grandmother said “ true love will find you when you least expect it."

~~~~

So, she confirmed that there are a lots of possibilities in philadephipa where she lived in.
She figured the number of men who meet her least expect.
The result was only 35.
So, she decided to try online-dating to get more big possibilities.

~~~~

This story starts from signing-on the online dating.

~~~~

At first, she wouldn’t lift a finger to answer about the system question for her profile.
She copied and pasted highlights from her job resume.
She said that she was an award-winning journalist and a future thinker. 
When she was asked about fun activities and her ideal date, she said monetization and fluency in Japanese. 
she talked a lot about JavaScript.

~~~~

Even if she answered such information, the algorithm matched a lot of men.

~~~~

This is one of such men, Steve, the I.T. guy.
The algorithm matched them up because they share a love of gadgets, 
they share a love of math and data and '80s music, and so she agreed to go out with him. 

~~~~

So Steve the I.T. guy invited her out to one of Philadelphia's white-table-cloth, extremely expensive restaurants.
He was ordering multiple appetizers, multiple entrées, also lots and lots of bottles of wine. 

When he gets up to go to the bathroom, 

~~~~

and in the meantime the bill comes to their table. 
But then he didn't come back. 

~~~~

She decided to hack the online-dating in the wake of such terrible date.

~~~~

At first, She listed 72 different data points what she requires to men.

~~~~

And then, she built her own scoring system.
She prioritized these points.
She broke it into a top tier and second tier of points, and she ranked everything.
On the top tier, the imperative points is listed.
On the second tier, you can see in this slide, the points which are also important to her but not necessarily deal-breakers.
 
~~~~

And she set the threshold value.

If it’s scored over 700 points, she would agree to email somebody or respond to an email message. 
If it’s scored over 900 points, she'd agree to go out on a date. 
Until somebody had exceeded the 1500 points threshold, she wouldn’t even consider any kind of relationship.

This system worked very well.

~~~~

She found Jewishdoc57 who's incredibly good-looking, incredibly well-spoken, he had hiked Mt. Fuji, and so on.

And she thought, 
“ I've done it! 
  I've cracked the code. 
  I have just found the Prince Charming of my family's dreams. “

~~~~

But there was only one problem.

~~~~

He didn't like her back.

~~~~

She thought that she need to do some market-research.

~~~~

10 fake male profile
So she created 10 fake male profiles 
to gather data of woman who were going to be attracted 
to the type of man that she really wanted to marry.

~~~~

One of such women is this, SmileyGirl1978.
So she recognized that content of profile matters a lot.
For example, popular men and women write 97 words on average in their profile.

~~~~

The other feature is using optimistic language. 
This is a word cloud highlighting the most popular words that were used by the most popular women, words like "fun" and "girl" and "love."

~~~~

And, photos matters.
All of the women who were popular showed some skin. 

~~~~

They were very different from what she had uploaded.

~~~~

Once she had all of this information, 
she was able to create a super profile, 
so it was still her, 
but it was her optimized for this ecosystem.

~~~~

Thanks to the super profile, she was the most popular person online.
Lots and lots of men wanted to date her.

~~~~

In her scoring system, they have to reach a minimum threshold of 700 points, and none of them have done that.

~~~~

But, not too long after that, she found this guy, Thevenin.

~~~~

His profile was scored 850 points. It was enough for a date.
Three weeks later, they met up in person and their conversation became lively.

~~~~

At that night, she re-scored him -- [1,050 points!] -

~~~~

And, a year and a half after that, when they are traveling, he got down on his knee and proposed. 
A year after that, they were married, and about a year and a half after that, their daughter was born.

~~~~

Congratulations!

~~~~

I said that there are two interesting points in her story.

~~~~

One is her unique method for data-science.
She created 10 fake male profiles to gather data efficiently.
And she built her own framework to evaluate profiles.

It means that what is important for data science is not only technology of statistics, but also originality and ingenuity to treat data.

~~~~

Second is her encouraging message.

She said that it was not wrong for her that she is picky. She hasn’t been picky enough. 

At the end of the speech, she said
“whether you're looking for a husband or a wife 
or you're trying to find your passion 
or you're trying to start a business, 
all you have to really do is figure out your own framework 
and play by your own rules, 
and feel free to be as picky as you want.”

~~~~

Especially, this message cut me to the heart.
“Feel free to be as picky as you want”

Thank you.
